# Ray-Portfolio-Project-1
This is a portfolio project analysing data of medical insurance data of both males and females in the US. Using control flow, lists, loops, dictionaries and working with files, I analysed data (in a really simplistic way haha) to gain a deeper understanding of some of the possible trends in the pricing of insurance for individuals in the US.
